# Problem Statement: Rotated Sorted Array Check

## Description

Given an array `nums`, return `true` if the array was originally sorted in non-decreasing order, then rotated some number of positions (including zero). Otherwise, return `false`.

**Note:** An array `A` rotated by `x` positions results in an array `B` of the same length such that `A[i] == B[(i+x) % A.length]`, where `%` is the modulo operation.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**

```java
int[] nums = {3, 4, 5, 1, 2};
```
